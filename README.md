### Job Portal Project 

## introdaction 

Technology is constantly changing. Society as we know it depends on this fact. In the early years of the twenty- first century, it is computers and the Internet that have captured the public imagination, and found their way into not just the working environments, but increasingly into the domestic spaces. In this modern society, if we are not capable of coping up with these changes then we are not going to stand or survive anywhere in this technical world. Today there is no place for errors, so to make a system more effective and efficient we need such technology where error prone chances must be least. In the scenario of the assignment, we are required to develop a web-based application on the Job Portal Management System. In this time of recession where everyone, is either experienced or fresher, is in search for a job. This job portal can prove to be very helpful since it allows users of different profiles to upload their CVs, search job on the basis of their qualification. Every user can access through user id and apply for multiple jobs at a time. Currently, we are working on a manual system where data is stored in the form of registers. Viewing available jobs, or applying for the job at the agency can be done for which job seekers have to go to the agency and check the available jobs at the agency. Job seekers check the list of jobs available and apply for the job. Then the agency will show available jobs for the job seeker for his qualifications and then updates the jobs database. The developed Job Portal management system is web-based which Requires Employee Registration & Profiles, Job Search, Employer Registration & Profiles, and Subscription Option for both Employee and Employer etc. Employers can add Own Profile and post jobs and Job Seekers can Search Jobs based on Geographical Area (Country, State, and City), Qualification, and Company wise or on the Basis of Experience and Expertise wise.
